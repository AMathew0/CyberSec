    <h1>AWS Organizations Setup & SCPs </h1>
  </header>
<main>

  <p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
  <p>Establish structured multi-account governance in AWS using AWS Organizations, enabling environment isolation, secure access, and centralized billing.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set up an AWS Organization with multiple child accounts for different use cases: production, application testing, cloud lab, and external trainer access.</li>
    <li>Implemented Service Control Policies (SCPs) to restrict high-risk services and enforce compliance across accounts.</li>
    <li>Used consolidated billing to manage cloud costs efficiently across all child accounts.</li>
    <li>Assigned separate accounts for training sessions and terminal-based access to reduce impact on core environments.</li>
    <li>Ensured secure access delegation between accounts using IAM roles and permissions boundaries.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enabled secure isolation between environments (production, lab, trainer)</li>
    <li>Utilized SCPs for fine-grained policy enforcement</li>
    <li>Streamlined billing and reporting with centralized account management</li>
  </ul>

    <p>✅ AWS Security Group Hardening – Reviewed and restricted inbound/outbound rules based on least privilege.</p>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
    <p>Strengthen cloud infrastructure security by auditing and enforcing least privilege principles in AWS Security Group configurations.</p>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conducted a full review of existing Security Groups across development, testing, and production environments.</li>
      <li>Removed overly permissive rules (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 for SSH/RDP) and restricted access based on IP, service, and environment role.</li>
      <li>Applied granular inbound and outbound rules specific to EC2, RDS, and Bastion Host traffic flow.</li>
      <li>Documented rule sets and implemented tagging for visibility and ongoing audits.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Minimized attack surface by locking down unnecessary open ports</li>
      <li>Improved compliance posture through least privilege enforcement</li>
      <li>Standardized security configuration across all AWS environments</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Project: Blue-Green RDS Migration (AWS)</h1>
  </header>

  <main>

  <p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
  <p>Perform a major version upgrade of a production RDS database (from MySQL 5.7 to 8.0) with zero downtime using a blue-green deployment strategy in AWS.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Web application hosted on AWS PaaS using a single RDS instance running MySQL 5.7 (extended support).</li>
    <li>Designed a blue-green migration plan to simulate and validate the upgrade before switching live traffic.</li>
    <li>Created a green RDS instance with MySQL 8.0, restored from a snapshot of the blue (existing) production DB.</li>
    <li>Tested the application against the green environment and validated query compatibility, latency, and performance.</li>
    <li>Performed DNS switch to redirect traffic after successful validation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Used RDS snapshots to build a rollback path in case of failure</li>
    <li>Achieved zero downtime without a Multi-AZ setup</li>
    <li>Monitored performance pre/post-migration using Amazon CloudWatch</li>
  </ul>

    <summary><strong>ðŸ§ª MeshCentral Setup for Remote Access</strong> â€“ Deployed MeshCentral to securely access test machines remotely and manage LAN devices.</summary>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
    <p>Implement a self-hosted remote access solution to manage test lab and LAN-connected devices securely and efficiently.</p>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deployed MeshCentral server in a lab environment for remote desktop, command-line access, and file transfer capabilities.</li>
      <li>Configured device groups and agent-based installations for centralized LAN device management.</li>
      <li>Enabled secure browser-based remote access using TLS encryption with role-based access control (RBAC).</li>
      <li>Tested remote shutdowns, reboot routines, terminal commands, and monitoring of endpoints across subnets.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eliminated dependency on third-party tools for remote access in LAN</li>
      <li>Fully self-hosted and firewall-friendly configuration using standard ports</li>
      <li>Effective remote control and support framework for test/training labs</li>
    </ul>

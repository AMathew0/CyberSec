    <p>ðŸ§ª CloneZilla Lab Deployment</strong> â€“ Explored disk cloning for recovery/lab duplication.</p>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
    <p>Evaluate CloneZilla for disk imaging and cloning to support lab recovery scenarios and rapid environment duplication.</p>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deployed CloneZilla Live in a controlled lab environment for testing image creation and restoration of Windows/Linux systems.</li>
      <li>Performed full-disk backup and recovery operations for various lab setups including training and testing devices.</li>
      <li>Validated time taken for cloning and restoration, tested compatibility across hardware variations.</li>
      <li>Documented image retention practices and local storage use cases for recovery-ready endpoints.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Achieved fast provisioning of lab machines through disk cloning</li>
      <li>Minimized manual OS and software installation time for duplicate setups</li>
      <li>Documented an image-based disaster recovery workflow for lab environments</li>
    </ul>

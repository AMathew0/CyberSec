    <summary><strong>✅ Cloud Lab Setup (Self-hosted, AWS + Open Source)</strong> – Built self-hosted lab using AWS Free Tier and local virtualization for training and testing.</summary>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
    <p>Deploy a cost-effective, scalable cloud lab environment using AWS Free Tier and open-source virtualization tools to support internal testing, PoC validations, and trainer-led sessions.</p>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provisioned 30+ EC2 instances with customized system specs tailored for software simulations, hands-on embedded tools, and cloud infrastructure training.</li>
      <li>Utilized Ubuntu, Docker, and other open-source technologies to replicate real-world deployment scenarios.</li>
      <li>Configured IAM, VPC, and Security Groups to ensure isolation and secure access across training environments.</li>
      <li>Integrated local virtualization (VirtualBox) for hybrid labs and offline access when needed.</li>
      <li>Provided trainers with consistent terminal access and role-based resource provisioning using separate AWS Organization accounts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed fully modular cloud lab for testing, demonstrations, and continuous learning</li>
      <li>Optimized for AWS Free Tier to reduce cost without compromising functionality</li>
      <li>Enabled multi-user training access with granular IAM policies</li>
    </ul>
